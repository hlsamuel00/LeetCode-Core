# LeetCode Core
These are some of the solutions that I've worked on for some LeetCode problems. I wanted to share to show my Pythonic programming skills

## What's Going On?:
I will be timing myself working through LeetCode solutions and uploading the final code here. The code listed here is after a workable solution was submitted and after I've taken time to reflect on the code, refactored, and added comments. I have also uploaded my LeedCode videos to Loom for self reflection and review to determine areas of opportunity I have with problem solving and with pattern recognition. 

**Tech used:** Python, Data Structures, and Algorithms

## Lessons Learned:
I learned a great deal working through these problems:
  * Problem-Solving: I get to hone my skill of problem solving with a wide range of LeetCode problems and identify certain algorithms that can be better suited to address concerns raised with finding the most efficient solution. 
  * Self-Reflection: By recording myself, I have the opportunity to dissect my areas of opportunity and help highlight what I'm doing well. All of this is for the sole purpose of accountability and to strengthen and hone my areas of opportunity and keep sharp my strengths. 
  * Determination: I will not get all of the problems I set out to solve correct on the first go, but staying focused and determined I will continue to strengthen my problem-solving skills to be able to tackle any problem that arises.
