*****LeetCode Workflow!!*****

*** Part I ***
    1. Understand the Problem (No Coding!):
        * Verify you understand the provided test cases.
        * Make sure to comprehend the problem requirements and constraints.
        * Propose at least 3 additional test cases you are and WHY you are selecting them

*** Part II ***
    2. Design a Detailed Solution (No Coding!):
        * Devise and plan your approach by experimenting with examples.
        * Verify the correctness and efficiency of your solution.
        * Takes notes in LC by Taking Notes on LC to record timestamps and brainstorm ideas and example input/outputs to solve the problem.  
        * Summarize your solution in words or bullet points

    3. Verify Your Solution (No Coding!):
        * Walk through your solution on each input to ensure its correctness by explicitly describing all intermediate steps (variables, loops, etc)
        * If your approach fails any test cases, return to step 2 and make necessary modifications or find a new approach.

*** Part III ***
    4. Implement and Test:
        * Keep the code short and simple. Simple Solutions Are The Best Solutions
        * Double-check for syntax errors. 
        * Test your code using example inputs and additional test cases.
        * Debug and fix any issues that arise. Debugging in LC and Interview

    
5. Reflect, Self Evaluate, and Study Other Solutions:
    * Read solutions on Leetcode and understand how they arrived at the answer. Why Should I Care About Alternative Solutions?
    * Implement the provided solutions using your own code, following the workflow from step (1)
    * Describe the solution in words and ensure it works on the intended inputs.
    * Implement the code and pass the test cases.
    * Self-evaluate your performance
